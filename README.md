netj's Homebrew-tap
===================
Here are some of my formulae that didn't/couldn't get into the [main repository](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core).

How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------
Just `brew install netj/tap/<formula>`.

Docs
----
`brew help`, `man brew`, or the [Homebrew Homepage](https://brew.sh).
