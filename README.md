netj's Homebrew-tap
===================
Here are some of my formulae that didn't/couldn't get into the [main repository][homebrew].

How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap netj/homebrew-tap` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from mxcl/master or another tap, you can `brew install netj/homebrew-tap/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.github.com/netj/homebrew-tap/master/<formula>.rb
```

Docs
----
`brew help`, `man brew`, or the Homebrew [wiki][].
